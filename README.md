# Clone Hero Bot
This is an idea I had after becoming more interested in Python. It is not intended to be used in a multiplayer scenario ever. 

## Simple Explanation
This program runs only on 1920x1080 monitors in fullscreen. It **should** work with any background or highway added by users. 
Using background subtraction the program captures a small portion of the screen and calculates if a change has occured. 
I have not tested it at faster speeds than the default speed. It should theoretically work as fast as your screen can refresh.


I will most likely add more to this readme at a later time, this is meant to be a brief introduction.
